# IndieCloud Template: `template-java-21-springboot-3.4-postgresql`

A minimal Spring Boot setup using Java 21, PostgreSQL, and JPA/Hibernate.  
Great as a starting point for real-world backend apps, side projects, or if you just want to avoid wiring up the same boilerplate for the 37th time.

## What's inside
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4
- PostgreSQL
- JPA/Hibernate

## How to use

### Option 1: Fork the repo  
Use GitHub’s **Fork** feature to create your own copy and push changes directly.

### Option 2: Clone & re-init git  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/indiecloud-dev/template-java-21-springboot-3.4-postgresql.git
cd template-java-21-springboot-3.4-postgresql
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

## Run it locally
You can run the app locally for development:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
>Note: Make sure you have Java 21 installed and set up.

## Hosting
This project is also ready-to-deploy on [IndieCloud](https://indiecloud.dev),  
but you can just as easily run it on your own infra or push it to any Git host.
